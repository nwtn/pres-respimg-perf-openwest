# Improving performance with responsive (and responsible!) images

OpenWest,  
2015-05-07

<http://joind.in/talk/view/13889>

> I will be speaking about the web’s hunger for more, bigger, and higher-resolution images, and the performance problem this creates. I’ll give a brief history of the new (and occasionally controversial) `picture` element, and discuss some other exciting new standards that are on the horizon. In addition to responsive image solutions, I’ll discuss techniques for improving image loading performance in general, including optimization and pre-processing, deferred loading, image format choice, caching, and use of CDNs. Attendees can expect concrete examples of how the new `picture` element works, and to learn how they can use responsive and responsible images right now to improve performance and deliver the best possible experience to their users.
